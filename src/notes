- loop over all characters

- make character look left or right (conditional rendering)
-
- add favourite/delete button
- think about where the state needs to live and the functions needed in the parent (lifting state)

2. Interface (bring in Characters component)
3. Characters (will do all the mapping and produce all the character components x 50)

'Think about where the state lives, how to get everything into the top, then pass it down, and how to divide things up into the correct # of components
